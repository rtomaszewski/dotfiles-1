2015-05-18 08:43:15	zalmoxes	[01:37:47] hi, all the flannel examples show communication between a cloud provider like AWS and your local baremetal datacenter. what's the security in this picture? is communication with flannel somehow encrypted or is there another recommended method?
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:39:40] non
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:39:47] flannel is not a vpn
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:39:56] nor a replacement for it
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:40:08] nor does it come with any security what so ever
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:40:20] its a simple udp overlay
2015-05-18 08:43:15	zalmoxes	[01:40:45] so how are people actually setting up clusters across public clouds? with vpn?
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:40:46] and it does not show cross provider anything
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:41:03] not with flannel for sure
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:41:04] :)
2015-05-18 08:43:15	zalmoxes	[01:42:03] here's one example http://i.imgur.com/4laAPMN.jpg
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:42:23] red_beard: !
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:42:33] brian your presentation is missleading
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:43:09] no flannel has no ipsec or anything else .. use it in the scope of a privat network
2015-05-18 08:43:15	steveeJ	[01:47:43] zalmoxes: you can have a look at tinc
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:51:22] steveeJ: ever dont tinc >
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:51:25] done*
2015-05-18 08:43:15	pkircher	[01:51:42] its nice but a pain to get up right .. and then you still need the overlay internaly
2015-05-18 08:43:15	steveeJ	[01:51:42] yes, but not inside containers
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:51:54] .. gre +ipsec works just fine
2015-05-18 08:43:16	zalmoxes	[01:52:14] setting up a hardware vpn connection between AWS and your local site works fine
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:52:14] ovs managed overlay
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[01:52:18] that sounds like a good idea, since it's probably faster than tinc
2015-05-18 08:43:16	zalmoxes	[01:52:32] i don't use aws atm though. was hoping I could do the same thing with digital ocean
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[01:53:05] which userspace utilities are you using for ipsec?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:53:22] containerized ovs ..
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:53:31] which does the pki stuff and gre tunnels
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:53:48] of for the flows .. to avoind stp
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:53:57] avoid*
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:54:07] but thats my setup ..
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:54:21] essentialy i spin them up .. and inject nics into containers ..
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:54:49] all kernel bridged instead of userland
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:55:07] the gre ipsec is x509 cert based
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:55:37] basicaly the same way you handle that stuff with openstack
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[01:58:06] the nic injection part sounds kind of fiddly
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:58:27] nah got that automated
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:58:41] i dont want docker to manage just a cider and assingn it
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:58:56] i need to have it persistent for some services
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:59:03] aka floating ips for docker if you want ..
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[01:59:10] what's the timeline for running a container with ovs network access?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:59:12] special for internal QoS
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:59:33] to get from 0 to where i am ?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[01:59:44] i spend about 1.5 months on it
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[01:59:50] I should've used lifecycle
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:00:05] is the network available to the container on startup?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:00:21] nah containers start without any nic
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:00:37] what if they're process requires network access right away?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:00:48] they dont :)
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:00:51] their
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:01:12] it has its internal lo interface
2015-05-18 08:43:16	zalmoxes	[02:01:18] ah got to the point where brian talks about there being no encryption and that flannel is designed for a single cloud provider
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:01:20] so it has a network stack
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:01:30] I see
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:01:40] sounds fiddly ;)
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:02:16] its not :)
2015-05-18 08:43:16	steveeJ	[02:02:27] I wanna try to use ipsec with rkt
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:31:16] zalmoxes. yup, its all a part of us doing gifee (Google's infrastructure for everyone else)
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:31:53] and in that case you don't really have tightly coupled components taking over a WAN
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:32:03] *talking
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:32:15] sorry, on my phone on the subway
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:32:56] brian is the training stuff gone for good ?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:33:05] zalmoxes: also, who's this "Brian" guy. ;)
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:33:42] pkircher: nope, but the folks I tried to hire full time to do the writing side didn't work out and my written words are garbage
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:34:06] me speak eloquent. me write bad.
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:34:11] want me to read over what you have ?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:34:51] nah. it's fine at the moment. its just a lot of things to do.
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:35:08] sure, understood
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:35:24] I'm also a kindof PM on tectonic so there's always too much to do
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:35:34] oh dear
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:35:50] well you not take the lowhanging fruit do you
2015-05-18 08:43:16	pkircher	[02:35:55] do*
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:37:50] i like seeing things done well and I'm picky about my team. things are on track for me getting another FTE soon assuming the next round of interviews go well
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:38:03] so I can duplicate myself
2015-05-18 08:43:16	red_beard	[02:47:18] ok folks. need to drop off to finish heading to the airport.
2015-05-18 08:43:16	songgao	[03:39:56] rkt run --pod-manifest .... fails with error: run: error setting up stage0: error setting up image {<nil> - []}: error rendering ACI: wrong key
2015-05-18 08:43:16	songgao	[03:40:35] any idea how/where I should try to fix it?
2015-05-18 08:43:16	songgao	[03:41:00] sorry the message is: run: error setting up stage0: error setting up image {<nil> - []}: error rendering ACI: wrong key prefix
2015-05-18 08:43:16	songgao	[03:41:44] I altered the ResolveKey function to include the key in the error, and the key turns out to be "-"
2015-05-18 08:43:16	songgao	[03:42:04] the same rkt works fine when running an ACI directly
2015-05-18 08:43:16	Freman	[05:13:16] etcdctl set /platform/maintenance/enabled true
