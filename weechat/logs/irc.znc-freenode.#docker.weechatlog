2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[02:27:54] i - I'm trying to get my head around linked containers with a view to composing. I understand that docker creates env vars for exposed ports. Can I somehow make this more generic?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[02:28:18] COUCH_PORT_5984_TCP_PORT for example, makes very little sense. If the port is not 5984, then the env var name will also be different.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[02:43:57] I can pass a -e PORT:5984 to the source container, but that doesn't seem to make it through to the destination container.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[02:49:25] cnf are you still around?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[02:59:55] Grokling: what's the source vs destination container?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:03:51] djx I've got a couchdb container(source of the port), and I'm trying to link it to a logstash container (consumer of the port).
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:04:59] Grokling: are you linking both containers with --link?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:05:22] I'm spinning up the couchdb container, then using --link when starting the logstash container.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:06:04] Grokling: cat /etc/hosts shows up the logstash on couchdb?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:10:49] djx, no, but then I wouldn't really expect it to - isn't that the wrong way around?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:11:30] couch shows up in /etc/hosts on the logstash container.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:12:55] Grokling: ah sorry, yeah that's it, but that way only logtash can "speak" with couch
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:15:05] That's fine..  Couch doesn't initiate anything anyway. My problem is that I'm trying to make logstash portable, so that I can just --link it to any couchdb (which will have an arbitrary ip address) and have it pick up the port and work. Somehow I have to get something into the logstash config file so that it can pickup whatever docker sees fit to pass it, and use that to configure it's plugins.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:19:07] djx: It looks like, docker aside for a moment, logstash's configuration file is not smart enough yet anyway.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Pinchiukas	[03:27:12] What's the best way to create a docker container that wouldn't exit? I want to use it for experiments - so that I'd be able to trash it and start over like with a VM snapshot.
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:28:06] Pinchiukas: just get it to start something persistent (like bash)
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:28:37] Pinchiukas: docker run -ti busybox bash
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:28:45] that's what I usually do
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Pinchiukas	[03:28:57] Is bash persistent?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	djx	[03:29:23] Pinchiukas: bash is a command, what you mean by persistent? what persistence are you thinking of?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Grokling	[03:29:36] bash doesn't end until you end it, so that should do what you want?
2015-05-18 08:43:17	Pinchiukas	[03:31:51] I was missing -ti, thanks, guys!

2015-05-18 08:43:17	lb5tr	[08:08:36] back in the fig.yml days I defined free env. ver. in fig.yml like this

2015-05-18 08:43:17	lb5tr	[08:09:40] container used this value to decide weather to reset the db or not (if undefined it would not)
2015-05-18 08:43:17	lb5tr	[08:09:52] so fig up -d run the container without the reset
2015-05-18 08:43:17	lb5tr	[08:09:55] but
2015-05-18 08:43:17	lb5tr	[08:10:01] RESET_DB=true fig up -d
2015-05-18 08:43:18	lb5tr	[08:10:05] would've reset the db
2015-05-18 08:43:18	lb5tr	[08:10:33] this approach doesn't work with docker-compose.yml anymore (the variable is not getting overridden)
2015-05-18 08:43:18	lb5tr	[08:10:44] any hints?

2015-05-18 08:43:18	lb5tr	[08:14:13] for pointing that out
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:14:27] i still have problem with accessing my repo :(
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:14:46] i tried restarting my vm - still the same - i cannot push
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:14:59] Q: i created the repo using a different vm
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:15:42] i mean i created the repo first using host1 - then i am trying to push image using host2
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:15:48] should this be a problem?
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:19:56] i now tried docker logout
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:20:00] and then docker login
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:20:07] with my u/p/email
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:20:13] still same problem :(
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:20:18] i cannot push images
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:21:33] journalctl says nothing too :(
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:21:40] only that i have access denied
2015-05-18 08:43:18	vdemeester	[08:26:11] Chanan: did not play with "local" repository but maybe take a look at what is in your .dockercfg, maybe ?
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:31:00] weird or not - it looks like i see the image on docker.com web site
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:31:18] and when i tried cleanup all images/containers
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:31:29] now i can do docker pull bchanan/apache:0.1
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:31:36] so why i got access denied?
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:32:54] ohh...its an old image :(
2015-05-18 08:43:18	Chanan	[08:33:01] which i already deleted :(
